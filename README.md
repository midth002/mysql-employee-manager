  ## Description

  The employee manager application is created in node.js and uses mysql backend. Users are able to input new departments, roles, and employees. 
  You will also be able to view these tables that you have to track employees and their roles and departments. This project uses npm packages like 
  mysql2, and inquirer to get user input into a relational database. The main menu is controled by a conditional switch statement that manages what the 
  user selects and what functions to run. Inside these various functions are quieries executing selects and update sql statements to retieve and send information.
